Abstract = {Although monitoring of treatment response is standard practice for many medical conditions, practitioners in mental health treatments, and substance abuse treatment in particular, have been slow to adopt these practices. Progress monitoring (PM), consisting of measurement and feedback, has the potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes. This paper reviews the existing literature on the effects of PM in mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Whereas previous reviews have examined aspects of PM in mental health treatment, this is the first such review to cover monitoring efforts in substance abuse treatment, conceptualized here as diverse forms of measurement-based care. To address drug use, monitoring in SUD treatment has typically relied on treatment attendance and urine screens as indicators of treatment progress. However, some research has shown that other means of PM can significantly improve SUD treatment effectiveness. Previous meta-analyses show tha},

abstract="The delivery of psychiatric care is changing with a new emphasis on integrated care, preventative measures, population health, and the biological basis of disease. Fundamental to this transformation are big data and advances in the ability to analyze these data. The impact of big data on the routine treatment of bipolar disorder today and in the near future is discussed, with examples that relate to health policy, the discovery of new associations, and the study of rare events. The primary sources of big data today are electronic medical records (EMR), claims, and registry data from providers and payers. In the near future, data created by patients from active monitoring, passive monitoring of Internet and smartphone activities, and from sensors may be integrated with the EMR. Diverse data sources from outside of medicine, such as government financial data, will be linked for research. Over the long term, genetic and imaging data will be integrated with the EMR, and there will be more emphasis on predictive models. Many technical challenges remain when analyzing big data that relates to size, heterogeneity, complexity, and unstructured text data in the EMR. Human judgement and subject matter expertise are critical parts of big data analysis, and the active participation of psychiatrists is needed throughout the analytical process.",

abstract="Big data is a term used for very large data sets that have more varied and complex structure. These characteristics usually correlate with additional difficulties in storing, analyzing and applying further procedures or extracting results. Big data analytics is the term used to describe the process of researching massive amounts of complex data in order to reveal hidden patterns or identify secret correlations. However, there is an obvious contradiction between the security and privacy of big data and the widespread use of big data. This paper focuses on privacy and security concerns in big data, differentiates between privacy and security and privacy requirements in big data. This paper covers uses of privacy by taking existing methods such as HybrEx, k-anonymity, T-closeness and L-diversity and its implementation in business. There have been a number of privacy-preserving mechanisms developed for privacy protection at different stages (for example, data generation, data storage, and data processing) of a big data life cycle. The goal of this paper is to provide a major review of the privacy preservation mechanisms in big data and present the challenges for existing mechanisms. This paper also presents recent techniques of privacy preserving in big data like hiding a needle in a haystack, identity based anonymization, differential privacy, privacy-preserving big data publishing and fast anonymization of big data streams. This paper refer privacy and security aspects healthcare in big data. Comparative study between various recent techniques of big data privacy is also done as well.",
