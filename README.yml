        Mental health treatment presents with complex informational
        challenges, which could be effectively tackled with big data
        techniques. However, as researchers and treatment providers
        explore these applications, they find a lack of infrastructure
        and ethical concerns hamper their progress. A unified approach
        of developing an ethically informed data infrastructure is
        necessary to proceed.

        As big data analytics progress in other fields, historians
        have began to consider how they can apply these techniques to
        their studies. Various studies demonstrate potential benefits
        of big data approaches. However, care must be taken to keep
        big data results in the overall context of traditional
        scholarship and to utilize appropriate historical and
        technical expertise to avoid introducing inaccuracy and bias
        into findings.
