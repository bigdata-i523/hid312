        Mental health treatment presents with complex informational
        challenges, which could be effectively tackled with big data
        techniques. However, as researchers and treatment providers
        explore these applications, they find a lack of infrastructure
        and ethical concerns hamper their progress. A unified approach
        of developing an ethically informed data infrastructure is
        necessary to proceed.

        As big data analytics progress in other fields, historians
        have began to consider how they can apply these techniques to
        their studies. Various studies demonstrate potential benefits
        of big data approaches. However, care must be taken to keep
        big data results in the overall context of traditional
        scholarship and to utilize appropriate historical and
        technical expertise to avoid introducing inaccuracy and bias
        into findings.

        Big data holds great promise in a number of fields, and mental
        health treatment is no exception. Effective big data applications
        have been developed for every stage of treatment, but not without
        difficuties. This is particularly true for passive monitoring using
        smartphones. While it provides improved resolution of consumer behavior,
        it has complications with privacy and implementation connected with use
        commercial software and streaming data. This project created an open
        source program which uses discrete exported data from smartphones to
        implement passive monitoring in a way that promotes consumer control of
        their data and independence from commercial interests. A working program
        which parses and analyzes smartphone data was created to demonstrate
        concepts, but would benefit from further development of parser options,
        analyses, and input/output file management in the future.
