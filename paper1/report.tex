\section{Introduction}
Big Idea: Mental Illness is a big societal problem, which could benefit from a big data solution.

What is Mental Illness? (One short statement)

Mental health difficulties are a common problem across the United States, and worldwide. Mental illness of some kind was prevalent among 17.9 \% of Americans in 2015, and of that number 4\% experienced serious functional impairment as a result \cite{nihmstats}. A 2014 meta-analysis study estimated that the worldwide prevalence of mental illness was 17.6\% and that 29.2\% of the world population would experience mental illness at some point during their life \cite{worldprev}.  

The effects of these disorders on individuals and societies is costly. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 36,035 people died during a suicide attempt in 2008, and that 666,000 sought emergency room care for self harming behavior \cite{cdcsuicide}. In 2013, the Social Security Administration reported that 1,947,775 persons received social security/disability benefits for either a mood or psychotic disorder, which is around 19\% of all recipients \cite{ssarecipients}. 
It is estimated that mental health issues had a \$100 billion cost on the US economy in 2002 \cite{nihmstats} (more recent stats), and in 2015 there were over 12,000 mental health treatment facilities in the US \cite{n-mhss2015}.

Mental health treatment attempts to address these pervasive and complex problems at an individual level. While this by nature results in a system that is heterogeneous and complex, treatment is still typically delivered through three common modes of practice: talk therapy, medication, and supportive services. Therapy attempts to help the person change the way they think, feel, or act. These interventions typically provide behavioral strategies or seek to harness the person's motivation to change. Psychotropic medications are utilized to reduce symptoms of mental illness to improve life functioning. Supportive services are a variety of other services which seek to directly help the person with mental illness to realize concrete life improvements. Some examples are case management, which seeks to coordinate all service providers towards the person's goals, supportive employment, which seeks to provide assistance in finding and maintaining a job, and peer-support groups, which connect persons with mental illness with other people who have similar struggles \cite{samhsatx}.

\subsection{The State of Big Data}

There is no immutable or standardized definition of big data. However, most conceptualizations include data with high volume (amount of data stored), velocity (frequency of data input or update), and/or variety (number of data sources or types). These qualities of volume, velocity, and variety are known as the ``three v's``. This type of data require specialized techniques in order to be useful\cite{bdconcepts}.

Thesis
Data related to mental health treatment fits the high-volume, high-variety, and high-velocity of Big Data. However, Big Data informed treatments are still early in their development, though the potential benefit is recognized.

\section{Big Data Applications in Mental Health Treatment}
The natural progression of mental health treatment is to first identify diagnose the person's problem. Then a treatment intervention is provided to improve functioning. Lastly, the person's progress is assessed to determine the effectiveness of the intervention (CITATION NEEDED). Big Data solutions are being explored for each of these steps.
\subsection{Screening and Diagnosis}
Mental health screening attempts to identify a person's primary mental health needs for the purpose of directing them to appropriate sources. Screening tools have long been used to increase clinical efficiency, but their accuracy is often connected with the skill of the clinical interpreter (CITATION NEEDED). The use of machine learning to create accurate predictive models could inform the screening process and increase efficiency. 

On a larger scale, several studies have explored using social media to identify mental illness in the general population \cite{detectdepressionsocialmedia}.

Similar to screening, diagnosis aims to identify a person's mental health dysfunction, but does so in more clinically robust categories (CITATION NEEDED). While this task could not be completely automated via big data analytics any time soon, attempts have been made to create predictive models, powered by big data to inform diagnosis \cite{machinelearnbipolar} \cite{bigdatabipolar}.

Predictive models are also being constructed from a variety of data sources to estimate patient outcomes, often utilizing machine learning techniques. \cite{bigdatabipolar} This technique has been applied to creating risk profiles, which take data from Electronic Medical Records and identify patient characteristics that are connected to negative outcomes, such as relapse and hospital admission. Studies have also explored models which predict patient mood states, based on past monitoring data, and predicting how patients will respond to specific interventions. While these examples were fairly accurate (68\% to 99\%), they were based on relatively small sample sizes \cite{machinelearnbipolar}.  Predictive models show promise of being an effective big data application in mental health treatment, but require further advances in machine learning techniques and uses on larger samples to confirm accuracy \cite{bigdatabipolar}.
\subsection{Interventions}
Once a person's mental health issues have been clinically identified, then interventions are assigned. Those traditionally take the form of talk-therapy, medication, and supportive services such as case management \cite{samhsatx}. With this design, services are limited by the number of trained clinicians in a given area. Web-based interventions have been explored to overcome this problem \cite{bitreview}.
\subsection{Assessment and Monitoring}
As a person receives treatment, tracking progress towards their goals is critical. Traditionally this is done by patient report via a tracking log or by clinician inquiry during a session, and is often hindered by a lack of patient engagement. One solution to this is active monitoring utilizing mobile devices \cite{bitreview} 

\cite{bigdatabipolar}.

Another possibility is passive monitoring, which would access information from a mobile device, and connect those to patient behaviors. This can be done using clinically informed algorithms or machine learning paired with self-report \cite{bitreview} \cite{bigdatabipolar}.
