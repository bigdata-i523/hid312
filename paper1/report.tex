\begin{abstract}
Mental health treatment presents with complex informational challenges, which could be effectively tackled with big data techniques. However, as researchers and treatment providers explore these applications, they find a lack of infrastructure and ethical concerns hamper their progress.

\section{Introduction}
Big Idea:

Mental health difficulties are a prevalent problem across the United States, and worldwide. Mental illness of some kind was prevalent among 17.9 \% of Americans in 2015, and of that number 4\% experienced serious functional impairment as a result \cite{nihmStats}. List worldwide stats. List stats on objective impairments, including suicide, unemployment, crime/incarceration, substance use.
It is estimated that mental health issues had a 100 billion dollars cost on the US economy in 2002 \cite{nihmStats} (more recent stats), and in 2015 there were over 12,000 mental health treatment facilities in the US \cite{N-MHSS2015}.
